# painter
Simple painter app using p5.js

This app is created as demo for implementing drawing algorthim from scrath.

I implemented five Drawing tools and one coloring algorithm.

1. Line drawing using Bresenhamâ€™s Algorithm.
2. Rectangle drawing using the line Algorithm above.
3. Circle drawing using basic circle equation.
4. Ellipse using ellipse midpoint algorithm.
5. Freehand (pencil) using Line drawing above.
6. Flood Fill using non-recursive queue based algorithm.
